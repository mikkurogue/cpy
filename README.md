# CPY - the cli file copy tool (but with a progress bar)

Are you, like me tired of doing `cp node_modules node_modules_2_electric_boogaloo` and waiting an eternity with no feedback?

Well then `cpy` is the tool for you!

Simply install the binary into your `/usr/local/bin/cpy` and away you go!

## Usage

`cpy <source> <targer>` to copy whatever you want to copy. Then watch some magic happen.
